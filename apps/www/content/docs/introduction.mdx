# Introduction

Liminal UI is a modern React component library built with **Ark UI** and **Tailwind CSS**. It follows the shadcn/ui philosophy of providing copy-paste components that you own and control.

## Philosophy

Unlike traditional component libraries that you install as dependencies, Liminal UI gives you the source code. This means:

- **Full Control**: Modify components to fit your exact needs
- **No Lock-in**: You own the code, no vendor dependencies
- **Type-Safe**: Built with TypeScript from the ground up
- **Accessible**: Built on Ark UI primitives with ARIA compliance

## Features

- 🎨 **Customizable**: Tailwind CSS for easy styling
- ♿ **Accessible**: ARIA-compliant components
- 🔧 **Developer Experience**: CLI for easy installation
- 📦 **Tree-shakeable**: Only bundle what you use
- 🌙 **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark mode support

## Quick Start

Get started by installing the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @liminal-ui/cli
```

Then initialize in your project:

```bash
liminal init
```

Add your first component:

```bash
liminal add button
```

That's it! Check out the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide for more details.
